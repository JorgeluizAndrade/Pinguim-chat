## Piguim Chat
Welcome to Piguim Chat, a real-time chat application that offers an agile and effective communication experience. In this project, we are utilizing a variety of modern technologies to create a robust and secure chat platform.

## Technologies Used
In this project, we are making use of the following technologies:

<ul>
 <li> Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering.</li>
<li>React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
<li>Redis: An in-memory database for efficient real-time data storage.</li>
<li>TypeScript: The primary programming language for enhanced safety and productivity.</li>
<li>Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for streamlined styling.</li>
<li>Zod: A library for data schema validation in TypeScript.</li>
<li>Pusher: A real-time messaging service for real-time chat features.</li>
<li>NextAuth: A library for JWT authentication and integration with external authentication providers.</li>
</ul>

## About the Project
Piguim Chat is a real-time chat application with the following features:

<li>JWT authentication to ensure user data security and protection.</li>
<li>Google authentication for easy and convenient login to the platform.</li>
<li>Friend invitations via email (within the application).</li>
<li>Real-time chat for instant communication.</li>


## Serveless
To meet the needs of real-time data storage and retrieval, we have chosen Redis. Redis fits perfectly as a message broker and offers an efficient data structure for this purpose.

## Real-Time Chat
To implement real-time chat functionality, we have opted for Pusher. Pusher provides an incredibly agile and effective real-time communication experience, allowing us to smoothly and robustly implement chat features.
